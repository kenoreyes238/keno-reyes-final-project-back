Anyways framework I used for UI: React Bootstrap | https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/

Started this around May, mainly because I was busy with other stuff besides internship and I wanted to understand the backend a lil more thru the lectures and videos in mod 4, esp the jwt stuff Used most of the repo provided by Connor to use for backend, except changing some of login and adding in the endpoints needed for my inventory app Started off with front-end, decided to make it simple and use Bootstrap for UI and some components on the app Video I watched to get an idea on how to make my backend/ tutorial-ish: https://youtu.be/CUsCMKXpBGE?si=zQAWzBTYV8GM5__t Worked between this and my internship project to learn more in-depth on backend especially on the endpoints and jwt
